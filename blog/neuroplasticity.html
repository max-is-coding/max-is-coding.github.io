        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity refers to the malleability of the brain. It modifies and creates new pathways 
             between neurons allowing people to learn new things. This is how you improve at unfamiliar
             tasks- by creating stronger connections in your brain.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a few ways of improving your neuroplasticity. This is done by providing your brain
             with stimulation and challenges such as learning a new language, travelling, reading,
             making art, exercising and learning to play an instrument. All of these things engage the
             brain in new and different ways, which is what creates the different pathways that
             strengthen over time. When you do something repeatedly over time, you get better at it.
             Simple! It’s similar to muscle memory where you get more and more efficient at doing
             something and it takes less effort as your practice, until it takes minimal power and you’re
             just very good all of a sudden.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way is by feeding your brain with good, nutritious food. specifically ones high in
             Vitamin D and magnesium. Some examples of this include walnuts, blueberries and
             avocado. You can remember walnuts specifically because they look like a little nutty brain!
             Exercise also goes hand in hand with this: healthy body, healthy brain! Make sure to take
             time to pump that blood around your body and get some new oxygen up there on a regular
             basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also make sure you get a good night’s sleep. Not much explanation is needed, everyone
             knows how much they are affected when they can’t get in a good 8 hours. All of the
            information goes in and immediately leaves as all your energy is spent trying to keep
             awake. But if you don’t get enough sleep, you can take a cheeky nap during the day to
             refresh. Naps encourage growth of dendritic spines in the neurons, so tell that to your boss
             when you’re next pulled into the office for sleeping on the job!

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>
            Having a Growth Mindset is basically about believing in yourself, and having a positive inner
             voice! It’s scientifically proven that thinking you can, means you are more likely to succeed!
             It opposes a Fixed Mindset, where you believe that intelligence and skills are innate, and
             that you are not able to learn new things- this happens especially as people grow older.
             Many people think that after a certain age they cannot learn a new language, it’s too late to
             learn to play an instrument, or even that it’s too late to go to university. This is not true at all!
             This causes people to try less hard because they already believe they will fail. SILLY
             SAUSAGES. If you want to do something, you need to try with gusto and faith in yourself!
        </p>
        <p>
            People can instil a growth mindset in others by encouraging them and praising them when
             they hit goals and achieve things, as well as when they make honest attempts. When they
             make an attempt at a new challenge and try to stretch themselves, we can help them by
             encouraging them and supporting them throughout the process. Not only does this positive
             affirmation work for others, but it works when you give yourself your own little pep talks
             along the way as well.
