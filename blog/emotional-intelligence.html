        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence is how we measure someone’s ability to relate to others and 
            understand their emotions and motivations as well as their own. Empathy, social skills, self 
            regulation and other similar things fall under the category of EQ. EQ thankfully is something 
            that you can raise with journaling, engaging in conversations with the intent to listen and 
            understand, and actively keep a positive mindset about yourself and those around you. 
            EQ is often more closely correlated with success than IQ.</p>

        <h2>How is it different from IQ?</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a measure of your reasoning, ability to solve puzzles, and use 
            information and logic to predict things. It is usually a little more rigidly set and less changing 
            throughout your life. It is not linked as closely with success as initially thought, as your 
            connections with others and ability to understand yourself turns out to be more important.

          <h2>How can I increase my EQ?</h2>

          <div class="divider"></div>
          <h3>Mindfulness and meditation</h3>
            <p>Mindfulness and meditation are one way of increasing your EQ. Learning how to just 
                observe things without judgement is a huge step in coming to understand your feelings and 
                the feelings of others without preconceptions clouding your judgement. Take a little time 
                throughout your day to relax and observe what you are feeling and let it be, without thinking 
                thoughts such as “I should…” or “I shouldn’t..” or “This is too…”. It will help you in 
                recognising what state you are in and non-judgmentally moving away from any potential 
                negativity you may be experiencing to make a good decision on what to do.
                </p>
            <h3>Journaling</h3>
          <p>Journaling is a good way of letting things out in a healthy manner. It is private and does not 
            need to be shared with others, so you can feel free to say whatever you may be thinking or 
            feeling. Just writing out your thoughts can tell you what is really bothering you as well, and it 
            can allow you to tackle the issues head-on after defining them. Processing negative 
            emotions is healthy and necessary for everybody.
            </p>
            <h3>Conscious Listening</h3>
              <p>We often find ourselves entering a conversation to be heard, and not to listen. This causes a 
                lot of people to feel like they are not being heard at all, regardless of how much they say. It is 
                really important that we all learn how to consciously listen to each other and take time to pay 
                attention when it matters. Conscious listening is when you listen intently to another person 
                without interruptions or the need to speak. You can focus not on what you are saying next 
                but what you are hearing. Then, you can loop, which is reiterating what the other person said 
                to make sure you understand what they meant through their words. This can help you 
                understand other people much better when you can listen to them consciously.
