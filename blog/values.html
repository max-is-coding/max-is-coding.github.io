        <h2>Personal Anecdote from S Schwarz (my flatmate!)</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>I believe that one of Max's strengths is her <i>creative mind</i> and willingness to try new things.
            I first met Max at university and we studied Japanese together. Our Sensei would set us 
           homework in which we would have to use designated grammar structures in an original 
           sentence of our own. Together to add more depth to the homework we would challenge 
           ourselves to make one story with all of the target structures included. This required more 
           forethought and creative problem solving to achieve. It was difficult but through mutual 
           support we were able to encourage each other and achieve it.

          <h2>Creativity</h2>
          <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Having a creative and individual mind has always been a value I have cherished since I was 
            young. Self-expression has always been a big thing for me, and I was always doodling things 
            and playing music as a child. I think to be able to create something of your own, whether it 
            be in the form of art or a new way of problem solving and thinking, is extremely important. 
            Each individual is unique and has their own way of viewing the world and processing things 
            and it is really important to express this and also be accepting of other people's ways. I think 
            this is something that led me into Web Development as I dabbled in it while I was teaching 
            and had an enormous amount of fun thinking up an idea for a website, problem solving and 
            getting those a-ha! moments when something I had been working on finally clicked together.</p>

                mistakes, and having fun.” - Mary Lou Cook</i></p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <h2>Curiosity</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
          <p>I've always been a curious person, and that has heavily influenced what I do and where I 
            have gone in life. When I find something that piques my interest, I will research and dive 
            deep into things and usually end up wanting to experience it for myself. This is how I found 
            myself moving across the globe and living in Japan for 2 years and Korea for 5. I wanted to 
            know what was beyond the borders and see it myself. I also have many interests and 
            hobbies that I have tried, which has given me a breadth of knowledge which helps me 
            connect with others through common ground. I am also curious about other people and 
            love to hear their story, as I believe everyone has a unique one to tell and deserves to be 
            heard.</p>

                Curiosity has its own reason for existing." - Albert Einstein</i></p>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <h2>Enthusiasm</h2>
                <div class="divider"></div>
              <p>When given a task, I find that (ADHD willing) I like to put my all into it and don't try to skate 
                by on the minimum. I love to form plans and ideas with people and like to make sure they
                 feel seen and listened when meeting someone new. I also dive into new ideas with
                 enthusiasm, and like to envision all the possibilities with optimism. I also think this is
                 important when working with other people, as others can sense a lack of enthusiasm and
                 can be negatively affected by it, but positively effects by seeing someone else's excitement.
                 I learned this quickly when I was a teacher, as bringing my own enthusiastic energy into the
                 classroom would in turn cause students to become enthusiastic about the topic and their learning. </p>

                <h2>Compassion</h2>
                <div class="divider"></div>
              <p>I believe that I while compassion has always been a strong value for me, I really learned the
                importance of it while I lived overseas in Asia. Not only did people show a lot of compassion
                for me and often helped me out when I was struggling because of language or cultural
                walls, I also made an effort to show it every day in my work. I was an EFL teacher and
                taught all ages, and I always tried my absolute best to communicate with my students with
                the compassion that was shown to me. They all had varying levels of skill, and I made sure
                that they all felt at ease when speaking to me and I would care for them as individuals as
                well. For example, I would talk to students who were worried about their grades or daily
                life and do my best to listen and give advice not just about English, but talk about what it
                means to learn, keep trying and follow your passions. All of my students were people on
                journeys just like I am. I believe that if we all show compassion and care towards each
                other, strangers and closest friends alike, we will lift each other up and create a good
                atmosphere where people feel safe and supported.</p>

                <h2>Strengths and Challenges as an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality">ENFP</a></h2>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <p class="middle">Curious - Perceptive - Enthusiastic - Excellent Communicators</p>
                <h3>Area of Improvement</h3>
                <p class="middle">Focus - Organisation</p>

                <p>My strengths in a working environment typically revolve around being able to navigate the 
                social side of things, and bring people together to work harmoniously. I feel I am a good 
                listener, and am adept at knowing when to check in on people and encourage them when 
                they need it. I'm also quite a creative thinker, and can think of solutions and ideas outside of 
                the box. Some things I need to work on are my ability to manage my time and resources 
                well, and bringing the many ideas that I have into reality and seeing it through.
                I think that both working well in group environments and my ability to think outside the box 
                will aid me in my learning journey. I can foster ideas well, as well as think of creative 
                solutions to problems, and I can share my ideas with a group, with the external pressure of 
                making sure we all finish in time and to a great standard pushes me along nicely.</p>

                <h2>Culture / Growing Up</h2>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p>I grew up in a dual-culture household, with my mother being Filipina and my Father being 
                    Pākehā. I think being biracial and having these two cultures blended together opened my 
                    mind up to a lot of compassion for people who are different, and curiosity about the world. I 
                    was also an only child, so when I was alone I would often draw or play music and had to be 
                    quite creative in the ways that I played as I usually had to stretch my imagination and think 
                    of fun things to do on my own. My mother would always be passionate about karaoke (as is 
                    common in Filipino households!) and would often be singing, as would my father on long car 
                    rides. Additionally I was (and still am) neurodivergent (ADHD, though not diagnosed at the 
                    time), which I believe enhances my enthusiasm for the things I love.</p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h2>Work</h2>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>An ethical decision I have made was to talkto my boss about the breach of Korean Labor 
                        Standards that I found while I was teaching English in Korea. I had seen only that this was 
                        the case for many places but not often talked about. Because it piqued my curiosity I ended 
                        up doing hours and hours of research. I found that my employer, along with the majority of 
                        academies in Korea, were giving 1-7 less days worth of paid leave than was legally allowed. I 
                        found this out at the very end of my contract.</p>
                    <p>I could have slipped away quietly and done nothing, with a guarantee that my end-of-
                            contract bonus and final pay were not at risk. However I realised my co-workers who were 
                            staying would not recieve the benefits if I sat and did nothing, and they were still contracted 
                            for at least 6 more months so I decided to gather my evidence and confront our boss 
                            myself. I had come to feel very strongly about it as it was unjust that these decade old laws 
                            were being ignored and employees were not receiving their due rest. With the laws printed 
                            out I plucked up the courage to ask to meet with my boss, and presented my case. I 
                            understood that it was not out of malice but out of a lack of knowledge, and because of my 
                            non-confrontational manner it went well.</p>

                    <p>She called her boss, and then the next day she called me in for another meeting. She let me 
                        know that not only would they be changing my contract to include my extra day, but every 
                        single other employee in the 200+ person business would have their contracts updated to fit 
                        the law, and compensated for fairly. I was ecstatic to find out what a change I had made due 
                        to me keeping to values of compassion, enthusiasm and curiosity. 
                        </p>
                        <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>One time I have tried to work productively with others but experienced tension was when 
                        my coworker and I were in charge of creating a curriculum for classes but were tasked with 
                        our own books to work on with no collaboration. We settled on themes together but after 
                        that had little communication between what was done. We worked at different speeds, and 
                        the books ended up with some major design and content differences between them, and 
                        there was frustration because of that. Knowing what I know now, I think it would have been 
                        better to work on the books all together in a shared document, with each person working to 
                        their strengths- eg, someone gathering the content, someone putting it together to design 
                        the pages, someone editing and then someone taking those and creating PPTs from them.</p>
