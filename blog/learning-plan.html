        <h3>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>Naturally, to become a Web Developer! I want to come away with the skills to 
            be able to land a job and ultimately be able to go wherever I want in the world 
            with the skillset that I acquire, and be able to bring projects that I envision to 
            life.</p>
        <h3>Strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h3>
        <p>I am very good at not giving up on things when it becomes difficult or 
            challenging, and I can push myself to create things that I can be proud of at
             the end of the day. A limitation is getting started in the first place and keeping
             on task when I am left to my own devices as I have ADHD and many things
             become a distraction to what needs to be done.</p>

        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>Teamwork when working with others whom I am not familiar with and 
            learning how to negotiate and come to happy mediums that everyone agrees 
            with when working on projects.</p>
        <h3>A commitment to how I will manage your workload in this programme:</h3>
        <p>I will wake up early and set a timer by my desk for when I will actually start to
            work! Even if it is some prep before class time. I need to get myself in the
            zone and an external signal will help me. Even if it is just a little agreement
            with my Google Nest. I’ll keep track of my time with Toggl as well, and take
            regular breaks to keep myself focused. I’ll make sure food and other chores
            are sorted in the evening so I won’t have to be bothered with it while I work.
            And I’ll make time to take a breather and walk around outside for a moment if
            things get muddled in my brain.</p>
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way:</h3>
        <p>When I realise I am slipping I know I can contact the facilitators for some help 
            as well as the other students as I know I work much better when I am learning
             from another person as opposed to text off a webpage.</p>
        <h3>What I expect from the Facilitation team:</h3>
        <p>I expect them to do their best to help me when I reach out to them while I am 
            stuck, to answer my questions when I have them, and to have supportive and 
            constructive advice for me throughout the course.</p>
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times...?</h3>
        <p>Nope! I planned things so I wouldn’t have any kinds of commitments while the
            course is on. I can focus on it 100% because I know that’s what I need to do!
            Anything that needs attending I can do on the weekend.</p>
