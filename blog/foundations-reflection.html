        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
            I know quite a bit about human skills already! Whether I put it into practice all the time is a different story, but it is something I’m quite interested in as I like learning how to better communicate and understand others.
            Meditation gets easier the more you do it!
            EQ is not only about understanding and reacting well to others but also understanding yourself and your own feelings well, too.

        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>
            Things like curiosity and perseverance are very important, because that is what will get you to your solution, not just having all the tech stuff stored in your brain. You have to work in a team when you code, so it’s important to be able to listen well to others and be on the same page. You should also be aware of how you’re feeling too, as it can affect how good of a job you’re doing if you’re in a bad mindset.

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
            Like I mentioned before, what surprised me is that a lot of this is stuff that I had already heard before. Things like active listening, mindfulness/meditation I’ve heard a lot about because of a psychiatrist on youtube (lol) and as things that are helpful to know when you have ADHD like I do.
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
            Writing the blogs for sure! And meditation. My mind is always going 100km/s so it’s difficult for me to just be in the moment without bopping my leg to a song in my head as I ponder over various responsibilities I am neglecting as well as wondering why I neglect them, wondering what my friends are doing, what I will do on the weekend, if I am able to finish, where I will be in a year’s time, if I should call my parents…
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
            Because! People can learn the skills but if they are an unpleasant and unco-operative person to be around, it’s likely that people won’t want to hire them.
        </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
            Well considering I knew a lot of it beforehand, I feel like not all of it was new learning, but for others it might be new concepts and these are all important things to know. Especially, in my opinion, learning how to listen not to express what you want to say, but to actually listen to what the other person has to say! Plus I don’t know if I would have fit a lot in my brain if there were much more tech to learn on my own haha.
