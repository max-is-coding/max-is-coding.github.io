        <p>
            My main approach to problem solving is to ASK FOR HELP! When you need help, 
            what do you do? You ask for it, of course! This can mean a few different things, such 
            as asking Google, to asking people for help! I also like to figure it out by breaking it 
            down and going piece by piece, using pseudocode before I crack some code out, 
            trying different methods and checking error messages and the console to see where 
            I went wrong.           
        </p>

            One time, I was horribly stuck on a part of the javascript intro piece in Sprint 3- 
            figuring out how to use a for each loop. My partner was online at the time. He is a 
            software developer and multiple times already had told me I could ask him for help 
            at any time but I was stubborn! I was putting off asking for help and doing all I could 
            on my own with little success. I checked the discord for people also stuck on the 
            problem, I googled it, I combed through google results but I could not figure it out on 
            my own. So I asked for help from my partner and he dutifully pulled up his tablet and 
            started sharing the screen, like a teacher writing on a blackboard. He went through 
            each step of a for each loop carefully, and I followed along, things finally clicking into 
            place! I felt so relieved and kind of proud of myself once I figured out the problem 
            with some help. I wouldn’t have been able to get it in that amount of time without 
            asking for assistance, and I got a much better understanding of how it worked.

            When I got to Sprint 4 I was feeling a lot more confident in what I was capable of, and 
            during the built in methods section I was able to solve the deBee portion of the task 
            with relative ease. I had to remove the word “buzz” from a string and then return it. I 
            looked at the previous problems that I had struggled on earlier in Built-In Methods, 
            looking at .join, .split, and good ol Google to give me that last piece of the puzzle. I 
            had struggled with .split and .join earlier so I was already familiar with it, and the 
            prior struggle made me work through and understand it a lot more. And then I knew 
            Google would be able to give me exactly what I needed to remove a word, so with a 
            little bit of tinkering I managed it quite quickly on my own. I felt very confident 
            afterwards, and happy with the progress I had made during the bootcamp so far.

        <h2>Using different methods</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
            <b>Pseudocode</b> - sometimes I forget to do it! But I feel like laying out what I have to do 
            for each step would be helpful. I usually just jump in and start doing it if I already 
            have an idea what to do however.
            <br>
            <b>Trying something</b> - that’s straightforward! That’s what I always do. I like to 
            experiment and try new things.
            <br>
            <b>Rubber duck method</b> - I haven’t tried this one yet, but I was thinking of investing in a 
            little friend to sit atop my monitor that I can talk to when I feel stuck.
            Reading error messages/console.logging - I always do this! I run the code after every 
            adjustment to see what is happening and make sure that things are being returned 
            correctly.
            <br>
            <b>Googling</b> - my saviour! It’s what I turn to first when I can’t figure it out on my own.
            <br>
            <b>Asking peers/coaches for help</b> - I tend to check the discord first to see if anyone else 
            has gotten caught in the same part, and then I post my own little call for help if I can’t 
            find it.
            <br>
            <b>Reflection</b> - I’m not so good at this one! I often rush 
            ahead out of excitement and come back to something when it appears in another 
            problem later instead.
